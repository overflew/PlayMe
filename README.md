======
This is a .NET based office jukebox created by Trade Me developers as part of FedEx Day 2012. 

It is made up of three main components: 

* The player itself runs as a console application (on top of a Mongo database), and streams from Spotify and/or SoundCloud.
* A Single Page Application hosted by IIS serves as the interface.
* Mongo DB

Documentation is being added slowly, but hopefully there is enough [in the wiki](https://github.com/TradeMe/PlayMe/wiki) to get you up and running. Ready to run versions of the Server and the Website are zipped in the root of the repository if you'd like to use the software, and of course the source is there for anyone who wants to get stuck in! Or if you'd like to be a part of the next Trade Me FedEx Day, [we're hiring](http://www.trademe.co.nz/about-trade-me/careers).

Props to [Alexandr](https://github.com/Alxandr) for his [Spotifire](https://github.com/Alxandr/SpotiFire) library which is fairly essential to our project. As is [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com)'s [libspotify](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify) library.
